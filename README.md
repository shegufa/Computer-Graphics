Lab01 contains codes to implement "Scan converting a line" using different approaches : 1. using direct equaion, 2. using DDA algorithm, 3. using Bresenham's Line drawing algorithm.

Lab02 contains codes to implement "Scan converting a circle" using different approaches : 1. using direct equation, 2. using trigonometric function, 3. Bresenham's 
Circle drawing algorithm.

LastLab contains codes to implement 2D geometric transformations such as: translation, scaling, rotation.
